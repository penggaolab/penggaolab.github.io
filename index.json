This review summarized the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways of PFOA-induced toxicity in animals and humans as well as their implications for health risks in humans. Traditional PFOA-induced signal pathways such as peroxisome proliferating receptor alpha (PPARα), constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), farnesoid X receptor (FXR), and pregnane-X receptor (PXR) may not be important for PFOA-induced health effects on humans. Instead, pathways including p53/mitochondrial pathway, nuclear lipid hyperaccumulation, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-serine/threonine protein kinase (PI3K-AKT), and tumor necrosis factor-α/nuclear factor κB (TNF-α/NF-κB) may play an important role for PFOA-induced health risks in humans. Both in vivo and in vitro studies are needed to better understand the PFOA-induced toxicity mechanisms as well as the associated health risk in humans.","tags":[""],"title":"Molecular mechanisms of PFOA-induced toxicity in animals and humans: Implications for health risks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhicheng Jin","Jessica M Berthiaume","Qingling Li","Fabrice Henry","Zhong Huang","Sushabhan Sadhukhan","Peng Gao","Gregory P Tochtrop","Michelle A Puchowicz","Guo-Fang Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1415923200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1415923200,"objectID":"f84feb1948a42330a440e878ec628243","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/14-jin/","publishdate":"2014-11-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/14-jin/","section":"publication","summary":"Oxidative stress triggers the peroxidation of ω-6-polyunsaturated fatty acids to reactive lipid fragments, including (2E)-4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE). We previously reported two parallel catabolic pathways of HNE. In this study, we report a novel metabolite that accumulates in rat liver perfused with HNE or 4-hydroxynonanoic acid (HNA), identified as 3-(5-oxotetrahydro-2-furanyl)propanoyl-CoA. In experiments using a combination of isotopic analysis and metabolomics studies, three catabolic pathways of HNE were delineated following HNE conversion to HNA. (i) HNA is ω-hydroxylated to 4,9-dihydroxynonanoic acid, which is subsequently oxidized to 4-hydroxynonanedioic acid. This is followed by the degradation of 4-hydroxynonanedioic acid via β-oxidation originating from C-9 of HNA breaking down to 4-hydroxynonanedioyl-CoA, 4-hydroxyheptanedioyl-CoA, or its lactone, 2-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA, and 2-ketoglutaric acid entering the citric acid cycle. (ii) ω-1-hydroxylation of HNA leads to 4,8-dihydroxynonanoic acid (4,8-DHNA), which is subsequently catabolized via two parallel pathways we previously reported. In catabolic pathway A, 4,8-DHNA is catabolized to 4-phospho-8-hydroxynonanoyl-CoA, 3,8-dihydroxynonanoyl-CoA, 6-hydroxyheptanoyl-CoA, 4-hydroxypentanoyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, and acetyl-CoA. (iii) The catabolic pathway B of 4,8-DHNA leads to 2,6-dihydroxyheptanoyl-CoA, 5-hydroxyhexanoyl-CoA, 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA, and acetyl-CoA. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments showed that HNE can be catabolically disposed via ω- and ω-1-oxidation in rat liver and kidney, with little activity in brain and heart. Dietary experiments showed that ω- and ω-1-hydroxylation of HNA in rat liver were dramatically up-regulated by a ketogenic diet, which lowered HNE basal level. HET0016 inhibition and mRNA expression level suggested that the cytochrome P450 4A are main enzymes responsible for the NADPH-dependent ω- and ω-1-hydroxylation of HNA/HNE.","tags":[""],"title":"Catabolism of (2E)-4-hydroxy-2-nonenal via ω-and ω-1-oxidation stimulated by ketogenic diet","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Songqing Li","Tong Li","Peng Gao","Runhua Lu","Wenfeng Zhou","Haixiang Gao"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1382054400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1382054400,"objectID":"1c3b9e2a9642bb89fc43f8ae4182ed88","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/14-li/","publishdate":"2013-10-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/14-li/","section":"publication","summary":"A type of ultrasound-assisted emulsiﬁcation–microextraction (USAEME) was applied for the extraction and determination of four phthalate esters (e.g., dimethyl phthalate, diethyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate and benzyl butyl phthalate) in aqueous samples prior to quantiﬁcation using HPLC-UV.

The dispersion of ILs and mass transfer were accelerated by ultrasound irradiation and temperature control processes. Therefore, no dispersive organic solvent was needed. Several variables, such as ionic liquid volume, duration of the ultrasound extraction, dispersion temperature, ionic strength and centrifugation time were investigated and optimized.
