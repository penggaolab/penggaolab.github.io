There are 24 articles in Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology (CREST) from 2018 to 2022 focusing on this topic. Bioremediation employs microorganisms to modify and/or degrade contaminants, while phytoremediation uses plants to remove, contain, and/or change contaminants. They cover different contaminants including traditional (nutrients, petroleum hydrocarbons, organo-pesticides, plastics, and heavy metals such as Cd, Cr, Pb and U) and emerging contaminants (pharmaceutical and personal care products, and perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances). However, these remediation technologies have limitations in applications including lengthy periods, environmental sensitivity, nutrient deficiency and contaminant toxicity. Therefore, improvement strategies including immobilization of microbial/microalgal cells, construction of microbial/microalgal consortia, and use of amendments have been employed to overcome its drawbacks. Further studies should focus on cost-effective strategies to enhance the efficiency of biological remediation and their environmental adaptability, especially under extreme environments and with emerging contaminants. Microbes, microalgae and plants with good contaminant removal capability should be coupled with engineering practices based on their interactive mechanisms among bio-association and contaminants at molecular levels.","tags":[""],"title":"Applications of bioremediation and phytoremediation in contaminated soils and waters: CREST publications during 2018–2022 Authors","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Our Genome Research paper entitled “Precision environmental health monitoring by longitudinal exposome and multi-omics profiling” has been mentioned in a report in Time magazine.

In addition, the cytotoxicity and underlying mechanisms of vegetable saliva extracts on human gingival epithelial cells (HGEC) were studied. The Plantago asiatica L.

However, PAL extracts which have the highest bioaccessible heavy metals did not present adverse effects on HGEC, which may be due to its inhibition of apoptosis by upregulating p53 and Bcl-2. Our results indicated that polluted vegetable intake caused toxic effects on human gingiva. The heavy metals in vegetables were not positively related to human health risks.

Among all the metals, only As in Soil-3 (S3) exceeded Chinese risk screening and Yunnan background values at 38.2 mg/kg. The average concentrations of Cr, As, Cd, Pb, and Cu in all soil samples were 47.79, 15.50, 3.11, 104.27, and 180.29 mg/kg respectively. Although relatively high concentrations of heavy metals were detected in soil samples, the highest dermal bioaccessibility of Cd was 3.57% with others' being lower than 1%. The bioaccessible dermal-absorbed doses (DADs) of Cr, As, Cd, Pb, and Cu from soils reflected acceptable health risks since all DADs were below the corresponding derived dermal reference values. However, the toxic data showed the extracts of S3 and S4 presented certain cytotoxicity in HaCaT cells, indicating the existing models based on dermal bioaccessibility and DADs may be not accurate enough to assess their human health risk. Taken together, the human health risk assessment should be modified by taking their skin cytotoxicity into account.","tags":[""],"title":"Dermal bioaccessibility and cytotoxicity of heavy metals in urban soils from a typical plateau city: Implication for human health","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peng Gao","Sai Zhang","Johnathan Cooper-Knock","Annika K Weimer","Minyi Shi","Lina Kozhaya","Derya Unutmaz","Calum Harvey","Thomas H Julian","Simone Furini","Elisa Frullanti","Francesca Fava","Alessandra Renieri","Peng Gao","Xiaotao Shen","Ilia Sarah Timpanaro","Kevin P Kenna","J Kenneth Baillie","Mark M Davis","Philip S Tsao","Michael P Snyder"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1660694400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1660694400,"objectID":"5ad5636f00829ca5491ee59638db8a67","permalink":"https://penggaolab.github.io/publication/22-zhang/","publishdate":"2022-08-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/22-zhang/","section":"publication","summary":"The determinants of severe COVID-19 in healthy adults are poorly understood, which limits the opportunity for early intervention. We present a multiomic analysis using machine learning to characterize the genomic basis of COVID-19 severity. We use single-cell multiome profiling of human lungs to link genetic signals to cell-type-specific functions. We discover \u003e1,000 risk genes across 19 cell types, which account for 77% of the SNP-based heritability for severe disease. Genetic risk is particularly focused within natural killer (NK) cells and T cells, placing the dysfunction of these cells upstream of severe disease. Mendelian randomization and single-cell profiling of human NK cells support the role of NK cells and further localize genetic risk to CD56bright NK cells, which are key cytokine producers during the innate immune response. Rare variant analysis confirms the enrichment of severe-disease-associated genetic variation within NK-cell risk genes.

Here, as a pilot case study, we integrated deep-profiled longitudinal personal exposome and internal multi-omics to systematically investigate how the exposome shapes a single individual's phenome. We annotated thousands of chemical and biological components in the personal exposome cloud and found they were significantly correlated with thousands of internal biomolecules, which was further cross-validated using corresponding clinical data. Our results showed that agrochemicals and fungi predominated in the highly diverse and dynamic personal exposome, and the biomolecules and pathways related to the individual's immune system, kidney, and liver were highly associated with the personal external exposome. Overall, this data-driven longitudinal monitoring study shows the potential dynamic interactions between the personal exposome and internal multi-omics, as well as the impact of the exposome on precision health by producing abundant testable hypotheses.","tags":[""],"title":"Precision environmental health monitoring by longitudinal exposome and multi-omics profiling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Min Xu","Yang Lin","Evandro B da Silva","Qinghong Cui","Peng Gao","Jun Wu","Lena Q Ma"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1651363200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651363200,"objectID":"79bed855b5921f156c160d68c39da9e7","permalink":"https://penggaolab.github.io/publication/22-m-xu-2/","publishdate":"2022-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/22-m-xu-2/","section":"publication","summary":"Arsenic (As) and copper (Cu) are common co-contaminates in soils. However, their interactive effects on their accumulation and distribution in As-hyperaccumulator Pteris vittata are poorly understood. A hydroponic experiment was conducted with As being 0, 5, or 50 μM and Cu being 0.32, 3.2, or 32 μM to evaluate their phytotoxicity, accumulation, and distribution in P. vittata. In addition, As and Cu uptake kinetics were examined using the Michaelis-Menten kinetics model. Total As and Cu concentrations in P. vittata were up to 487 and 1355 mg kg−1. About 39–81% of the As was in the fronds compared to 0.6–18% for Cu. At 50 μM As, increasing Cu concentration from 0.32 to 32 μM increased root As while decreasing frond As concentrations, with the translocation factor (ratio of As in fronds to roots) being reduced from 4.0 to 0.31. In contrast, As did not affect Cu accumulation in P. vittata. Michaelis constant Km value for As was higher than that of Cu (6.49–24.9 vs. 0.43–3.36), consistent with higher Cu uptake than As. Besides, Cu reduced root K but increased P levels in the roots, whereas As increased the K and P concentrations in the fronds. Our results suggest that P. vittata accumulated more Cu than As in the roots, contributing to its low As translocation. As such, high levels of Cu are likely to reduce As uptake by P. vittata during phytoremediation of As-contaminated sites.","tags":[""],"title":"Effects of copper and arsenic on their uptake and distribution in As-hyperaccumulator Pteris vittata","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Congratulations to Dr. Gao for pulishing his first acritle at Pitt entitled “Dermal bioaccessibility and cytotoxicity of heavy metals in urban soils from a typical plateau city: Implication for human health” as the co-first author in Science of The Total Environment!\nDetails can be found: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969722026407?via%3Dihub\n","date":1651017600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651017600,"objectID":"56ca50d0cc008b0dd098d05c08a75049","permalink":"https://penggaolab.github.io/post/22-04-27-stoen-paper/","publishdate":"2022-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/22-04-27-stoen-paper/","section":"post","summary":"Congratulations to Dr. Gao for pulishing his first acritle at Pitt entitled “Dermal bioaccessibility and cytotoxicity of heavy metals in urban soils from a typical plateau city: Implication for human health” as the co-first author in Science of The Total Environment!\nDetails can be found: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969722026407?via%3Dihub\n","tags":null,"title":"Dr. Gao's first paper at Pitt on dermal exposure of heavy metal polluted soil has been published in Science of The Total Environment","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Congratulations to Dr. Gao for being awarded the 2022 Excellent Reviewers Award from Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology (CREST)!

In general, AOPEs showed endocrine-disrupting effects by disrupting the hormone level and by behaving estrogen receptor, androgen receptor, mineralocorticoid receptor, glucocorticoid receptor, and thyroid hormone receptor agonistic/antagonistic activity. AOPEs also exerted metabolic disrupting effects in the cardiovascular system and liver by disrupting the lipids hemostasis and by binding with liver X receptor and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ. Furthermore, we predicted the endocrine disrupting toxicity of emerging AOPEs by comparing their structures with the legacy AOPEs, but further studies should confirm the toxicity and the underlying molecular mechanisms of emerging AOPEs in the environment.

The effect of Fe on As uptake can be influenced by the addition of biochar, but has not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, the effects of maize straw-derived biochar (MB) on Fe and As translocation were determined by analysing the Fe and As concentrations in pore water, dithionite-citrate-bicarbonate (DCB) extracts, and rice plants. As-contaminated soils were supplemented with 0 or 1% biochar and 0 or 90 mg kg−1 P, and rice plants were grown for 70 d. Results indicated that biochar addition increased the concentrations of Fe and As in pore water, while P did not affect them. Additionally, biochar promoted the accumulation of Fe and As in roots. However, the rice biomass increased by 28% upon biochar addition, indicating that the rice plants became more tolerant to As toxicity with biochar. Specifically, biochar increased the root triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) reductive intensity, reduced the root H2O2 concentration, and promoted iron plaque (IP) formation. Moreover, the positive correlation between IP/DCB-extractable As and crystalline Fe on the rice root surface indicated that crystalline Fe appeared to be the determinant species of IP and played a central role in As segregation. In addition, biochar increased both crystalline Fe formation on the root surface and the Fe content in the cell wall, which enhanced As sequestration. Overall, rice could effectively tolerate As stress under biochar treatment since As could be retained on the root surface and root cell wall with MB.","tags":[""],"title":"Biochar promotes arsenic sequestration on iron plaques and cell walls in rice roots","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jialin Xu","Wenxin Hu","Donghai Liang","Peng Gao"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1641081600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641081600,"objectID":"6e0fb63de55834485af7ecdbc1970463","permalink":"https://penggaolab.github.io/publication/22-j-xu/","publishdate":"2022-01-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/22-j-xu/","section":"publication","summary":"Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is one of the main pollutants in the atmosphere and poses a huge threat to public health. Secondary aerosol pollutants that are formed by precursor pollutants in the atmosphere represent a large proportion of PM2.5; furthermore, photochemical reactions play an important role in their transformation processes. This review systematically presents the chemical and toxicological transformations of secondary organic aerosol (SOA), secondary inorganic aerosol (SIA), and metal species in PM2.5 under photochemical conditions. Specifically, major SOAs and SIAs are observed to be formed from volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and sulfur/nitrogen oxides through photochemical reactions, while metal species in PM2.5 participate in a series of photochemical reactions. Additionally, we compare the toxicities of precursor pollutants with their secondary pollutants after photochemical reactions. In general, major SOAs are found to be more toxic than their precursors, while major SIAs are less toxic than their precursors. As different metal species have different toxicities, changes in their toxicities after photoreaction depend on the specific metal and the photochemical reaction. By demonstrating that photochemical reactions can affect the toxicities of PM2.5 components, this review provides a promising perspective toward reducing air pollution and its health risks by investigating the related photochemical reactions.","tags":[""],"title":"Photochemical impacts on the toxicity of PM2.5","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peng Gao","Michael Snyder"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1638835200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1638835200,"objectID":"8f70cc25ead1b73a72f58ec9018ebeaf","permalink":"https://penggaolab.github.io/publication/21-gao-2/","publishdate":"2021-12-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/21-gao-2/","section":"publication","summary":"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a group of conditions that happen concurrently which increases the risks of stroke, cardiovascular diseases, and type 2 diabetes.

MetS and its components are caused by the complex interactions between various genetic, behavioral, and environmental factors, whose detailed mechanistic understanding is unclear. Previously, significant advances have been made in identifying the genetic determinants, epigenetic alterations, and proteomic/metabolic networks that play essential roles in the etiology and progression of MetS. However, we are still uncertain about what environmental and lifestyle triggers the onset and progression of the individual’s abnormal metabolic alterations. As such, the genetic heritability of the MetS only ranges from 10 to 30%, indicating both genetic and environmental factors play essential roles.

Although advances in omics technology have dramatically broadened the understanding of internal molecular and cellular mechanisms, understanding of the external environmental exposures, especially at the personal level, is still rudimentary in comparison. This is largely owing to our limited ability to efficiently collect the personal environmental exposome (PEE) and extract the nucleic acids and chemicals from PEE. Here we describe a protocol that integrates hardware and experimental pipelines to collect and decode biotic and abiotic external exposome at the individual level. The described protocol has several advantages over conventional approaches, such as exposome monitoring at the personal level, decontamination steps to increase sensitivity and simultaneous capture and high-throughput profiling of biotic and abiotic exposures. The protocol takes ~18 h of bench time over 2–3 d to prepare samples for high-throughput profiling and up to a couple of weeks of instrumental time to analyze, depending on the number of samples. Hundreds to thousands of species and organic compounds could be detected in the airborne particulate samples using this protocol. The composition and complexity of the biotic and abiotic substances are heavily influenced by the sampling spatiotemporal factors. Basic skillsets in molecular biology and analytical chemistry are required to carry out this protocol. This protocol could be modified to decode biotic and abiotic substances in other types of low or ultra-low input samples.","tags":[""],"title":"Decoding personal biotic and abiotic airborne exposome","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peng Gao"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1610064000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1610064000,"objectID":"a48a9a748da26dc729b1b21ef31835bd","permalink":"https://penggaolab.github.io/publication/21-gao-1/","publishdate":"2021-01-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/21-gao-1/","section":"publication","summary":"Current studies on environmental chemistry mainly focus on a single stressor or single group of stressors, which does not reflect the multiple stressors in the dynamic exposome we are facing.

Though chemical, biological, and physical stressors all pose health threats, the susceptibilities of different organisms are different. As such, significant relationships and interactions of the chemical, biological, and physical stressors in the environment and their holistic environmental and biological consequences remain unclear. Fortunately, the rapid developments in various techniques, as well as the concepts of multistressors in the exposome and multireceptor in One Health provide the possibilities to understand our environment better. Since the combined stressor is location-specific and mixture toxicity is species-specific, more comprehensive frameworks to guide risk assessment and environmental treatment are urgently needed. Here, three conceptual frameworks to categorize unknown stressors, spatially visualize the riskiest stressors, and investigate the combined effects of multiple stressors across multiple species within the concepts of the exposome and One Health are proposed for the first time.","tags":[""],"title":"The Exposome in the Era of One Health","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Evandro B da Silva","Peng Gao","Min Xu","Dongxing Guan","Xianjin Tang","Lena Q Ma"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1598918400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598918400,"objectID":"6f5d19737aee341e8a219f7acfb61e7e","permalink":"https://penggaolab.github.io/publication/20-da-silva/","publishdate":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/20-da-silva/","section":"publication","summary":"Soil contamination in urban environment by trace metals is of public concerns. For better risk assessment, it is important to determine their background concentrations in urban soils. For this study, we determined the background concentrations of 9 trace metals including As, Ba, Cd, Co, Cu, Ni, Pb, Se, and Zn in 214 urban soils in Florida from two large cities (Orlando and Tampa) and 4 small cities (Clay County, Ocala, Pensacola and West Palm Beach). The objectives were to determine 1) total concentrations of trace metals in urban soils in cities of different size; 2) compare background concentrations to Florida Soil Cleanup Target Levels (FSCTLs); and 3) determine their distribution and variability in urban soils via multivariate statistical analysis. Elemental concentrations in urban soils were variable, with Pb being the highest in 5 cities (165–552 mg kg−1) and Zn being the highest concentration in Tampa (1,000 mg kg−1). Besides, the As and Pb concentrations in some soils exceeded the FSCTL for residential sites at 2.1 mg kg−1 As and 400 mg kg−1 Pb. Among the cities, Clay County and Orlando had the lowest concentrations for most elements, with Cd, Co, and As being the lowest while Ba, Pb and Zn being the highest. Among all values, geometric means were the lowest while 95th percentile was the highest for all metals. Most 95th percentile values were 2–3 folds higher than the GM data, with Pb presenting the greatest difference, being 4 times greater than GM value (58.9 vs. 13.6 mg kg−1). Still they were lower than FSCTL, with As exceeding FSCTL for residential sites at 2.1 mg kg−1. In addition, the linear discriminate analysis showed distinct separation among the cities - Ocala (Ba \u0026 Ni) and Pensacola (As \u0026 Pb) were distinctly different from each other and from other cities with higher metal concentrations.

Pot experiments were conducted to investigate the risk of P contamination and the P supply rate to crops with the application of maize straw-derived biochar (BM) and P fertilizer. The biochar increased 18.3% and 8.45% total phosphorus (TP) concentration in the low-P level and high-P level soils, respectively. The addition of biochar increased the phosphorus activation coefficient (PAC) by 9.00% at low-P levels, while the PAC was reduced by 10.4% at high-P levels. The results suggested that biochar could serve as either a source or a sink for P. The P concentration in the dithionite-citrate-bicarbonate (DCB) extracts on the root surfaces in biochar-treated soils increased by 467.1% and 46.1% in the low-P level and high-P level soils, respectively. It may cause by the acidification of soils near the root and the increase in Fe plaque. The results also showed the addition of biochar increased the DCB-P concentration and subsequently promoted rice growth. The biochar additions enhanced bacterial community richness and diversity, while the P supplementations inhibited bacterial growth. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that available nitrogen (AN), Fe-P, Ca-P, P uptake and, DCB extracted Fe (DCB-Fe) were significantly correlated with microbial community composition and explained 46.8%, 37.1%, 38.0%, 37.5% and 36.7% of the total community variability, respectively.

Isotopic fractionation effects occur after environmental transportation of PAHs such as deposition and burial. This characteristic makes this method useful in source identification. Here, we provided a comprehensive review of tracing sources of soil PAHs using stable C isotopic fingerprinting technique. Fractionation of C isotopes occurs during formation and degradation processes of PAHs, making them useful tools to trace sources of PAHs in soils. The fundamentals of δ13C measurement and compound-specific isotopic analysis to trace sources of soil PAHs are summarized. Furthermore, for the first time, the biogeochemical cycle and contamination source evaluation based on δ13C signatures for soil PAHs are proposed. In addition, radioactive C isotope and stable H isotope ratios of PAHs are also briefly introduced as supplementary techniques.

We previously reported two parallel catabolic pathways of HNE. In this study, we report a novel metabolite that accumulates in rat liver perfused with HNE or 4-hydroxynonanoic acid (HNA), identified as 3-(5-oxotetrahydro-2-furanyl)propanoyl-CoA. In experiments using a combination of isotopic analysis and metabolomics studies, three catabolic pathways of HNE were delineated following HNE conversion to HNA. (i) HNA is ω-hydroxylated to 4,9-dihydroxynonanoic acid, which is subsequently oxidized to 4-hydroxynonanedioic acid. This is followed by the degradation of 4-hydroxynonanedioic acid via β-oxidation originating from C-9 of HNA breaking down to 4-hydroxynonanedioyl-CoA, 4-hydroxyheptanedioyl-CoA, or its lactone, 2-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA, and 2-ketoglutaric acid entering the citric acid cycle. (ii) ω-1-hydroxylation of HNA leads to 4,8-dihydroxynonanoic acid (4,8-DHNA), which is subsequently catabolized via two parallel pathways we previously reported. In catabolic pathway A, 4,8-DHNA is catabolized to 4-phospho-8-hydroxynonanoyl-CoA, 3,8-dihydroxynonanoyl-CoA, 6-hydroxyheptanoyl-CoA, 4-hydroxypentanoyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, and acetyl-CoA. (iii) The catabolic pathway B of 4,8-DHNA leads to 2,6-dihydroxyheptanoyl-CoA, 5-hydroxyhexanoyl-CoA, 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA, and acetyl-CoA. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments showed that HNE can be catabolically disposed via ω- and ω-1-oxidation in rat liver and kidney, with little activity in brain and heart. Dietary experiments showed that ω- and ω-1-hydroxylation of HNA in rat liver were dramatically up-regulated by a ketogenic diet, which lowered HNE basal level. HET0016 inhibition and mRNA expression level suggested that the cytochrome P450 4A are main enzymes responsible for the NADPH-dependent ω- and ω-1-hydroxylation of HNA/HNE.","tags":[""],"title":"Catabolism of (2E)-4-hydroxy-2-nonenal via ω-and ω-1-oxidation stimulated by ketogenic diet","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Songqing Li","Tong Li","Peng Gao","Runhua Lu","Wenfeng Zhou","Haixiang Gao"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1382054400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1382054400,"objectID":"1c3b9e2a9642bb89fc43f8ae4182ed88","permalink":"https://penggaolab.github.io/publication/14-li/","publishdate":"2013-10-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/14-li/","section":"publication","summary":"A type of ultrasound-assisted emulsiﬁcation–microextraction (USAEME) was applied for the extraction and determination of four phthalate esters (e.g., dimethyl phthalate, diethyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate and benzyl butyl phthalate) in aqueous samples prior to quantiﬁcation using HPLC-UV. The simultaneous injection of the extraction solvent and ultrasonication of the mixture results in an efficient extraction with the extractant well-dispersed in the sample. The parameters affecting the experimental results were analyzed and optimized through the design of the experiment. Using a central composite face-centered design, the results of 28 experimental data points were analyzed and validated. An optimal set of operating conditions was obtained using 40 μL of 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane and 1% NaCl subjected to 2.0 min of ultrasonication under natural pH. Under optimized conditions, the extractions resulted in analyte recoveries of 75–87% and high enrichment factors of 356–415. The calibration curves were linear, and the correlation coefficients ranged from 0.9992 to 0.9997 at concentrations of 5 to 300 μg L−1. The RSDs (n = 5) were 5.6–7.9%.

Seven bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ionic liquids were synthesized. After comparing the physicochemical properties of the ionic liquids and their application to microextraction experiments, 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([C6MIM][NTf2]), which has moderate surface tension and viscosity, was selected as the extraction solvent. The dispersion of ILs and mass transfer were accelerated by ultrasound irradiation and temperature control processes. Therefore, no dispersive organic solvent was needed. Several variables, such as ionic liquid volume, duration of the ultrasound extraction, dispersion temperature, ionic strength and centrifugation time were investigated and optimized. Under the optimum conditions, the calibration curve was linear in the range of 0.1–600 μg L−1 for chlorfenapyr and fenpyroximate and 0.5–600 μg L−1 for spirodiclofen, with correlation coefficients of 0.9994–0.9999. The enrichment factors were between 261 and 285. The limits of detection (LODs) were 0.02–0.06 μg L−1. Real fruit juice samples (at fortified levels of 10 μg L−1 and 30 μg L−1) were successfully analyzed using the proposed method.

The method is based on the combination of ultrasound-assisted DLLME with in situ ionic liquid (IL) DLLME into one extraction procedure and achieved better performance than widely used DLLME procedures. Chlorobenzene was used as the extraction solvent during the first extraction. Hydrophilic IL 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride was used as a dispersive solvent during the first extraction and as an extraction solvent during the second extraction after an in situ chloride exchange by bis[(trifluoromethane)sulfonyl]imide.
