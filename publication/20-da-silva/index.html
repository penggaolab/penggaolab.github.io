  <meta name="description" content="Soil contamination in urban environment by trace metals is of public concerns. For better risk assessment, it is important to determine their background concentrations in urban soils. For this study, we determined the background concentrations of 9 trace metals including As, Ba, Cd, Co, Cu, Ni, Pb, Se, and Zn in 214 urban soils in Florida from two large cities (Orlando and Tampa) and 4 small cities (Clay County, Ocala, Pensacola and West Palm Beach). The objectives were to determine 1) total concentrations of trace metals in urban soils in cities of different size; 2) compare background concentrations to Florida Soil Cleanup Target Levels (FSCTLs); and 3) determine their distribution and variability in urban soils via multivariate statistical analysis. Elemental concentrations in urban soils were variable, with Pb being the highest in 5 cities (165–552 mg kg−1) and Zn being the highest concentration in Tampa (1,000 mg kg−1). Besides, the As and Pb concentrations in some soils exceeded the FSCTL for residential sites at 2.1 mg kg−1 As and 400 mg kg−1 Pb. Among the cities, Clay County and Orlando had the lowest concentrations for most elements, with Cd, Co, and As being the lowest while Ba, Pb and Zn being the highest. Among all values, geometric means were the lowest while 95th percentile was the highest for all metals. Most 95th percentile values were 2–3 folds higher than the GM data, with Pb presenting the greatest difference, being 4 times greater than GM value (58.9 vs. 13.6 mg kg−1). Still they were lower than FSCTL, with As exceeding FSCTL for residential sites at 2.1 mg kg−1. In addition, the linear discriminate analysis showed distinct separation among the cities - Ocala (Ba &amp; Ni) and Pensacola (As &amp; Pb) were distinctly different from each other and from other cities with higher metal concentrations. The large variations among elemental concentrations showed the importance to establish proper background concentrations of trace metals in urban soils." />

    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p class="pub-abstract">Soil contamination in urban environment by trace metals is of public concerns. For better risk assessment, it is important to determine their background concentrations in urban soils. For this study, we determined the background concentrations of 9 trace metals including As, Ba, Cd, Co, Cu, Ni, Pb, Se, and Zn in 214 urban soils in Florida from two large cities (Orlando and Tampa) and 4 small cities (Clay County, Ocala, Pensacola and West Palm Beach). The objectives were to determine 1) total concentrations of trace metals in urban soils in cities of different size; 2) compare background concentrations to Florida Soil Cleanup Target Levels (FSCTLs); and 3) determine their distribution and variability in urban soils via multivariate statistical analysis. Elemental concentrations in urban soils were variable, with Pb being the highest in 5 cities (165–552 mg kg−1) and Zn being the highest concentration in Tampa (1,000 mg kg−1). Besides, the As and Pb concentrations in some soils exceeded the FSCTL for residential sites at 2.1 mg kg−1 As and 400 mg kg−1 Pb. Among the cities, Clay County and Orlando had the lowest concentrations for most elements, with Cd, Co, and As being the lowest while Ba, Pb and Zn being the highest. Among all values, geometric means were the lowest while 95th percentile was the highest for all metals. Most 95th percentile values were 2–3 folds higher than the GM data, with Pb presenting the greatest difference, being 4 times greater than GM value (58.9 vs. 13.6 mg kg−1). Still they were lower than FSCTL, with As exceeding FSCTL for residential sites at 2.1 mg kg−1. In addition, the linear discriminate analysis showed distinct separation among the cities - Ocala (Ba &amp; Ni) and Pensacola (As &amp; Pb) were distinctly different from each other and from other cities with higher metal concentrations. The large variations among elemental concentrations showed the importance to establish proper background concentrations of trace metals in urban soils.</p>
